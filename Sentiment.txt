And the plot developed ! And it was all uphill from there . Pacino is magical   and Keller keeps talking about how bored she is .. hello , dear , you 're not alone . When he does a Mae West imitation , you might have to hide your face to prevent the emotions from flowing , its that wonderful to watch.<br /><br />I ca n't imagine how either actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved with this , or a better question , why it ended up magnificent < br /><br />Since death is represented in almost every scene , one way or another , maybe you 're supposed to have high emotion here . Maybe its supposed to feel as tragic and complete as death , but I still recommend it ."

A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players . We never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them . They gradually turn into good players by meditating . Also there are too many characters and good character development . Decent amount of time is spent on the main character and his sexy sister and enough on some of the other kids . This could have had a ' Bad News Bears ' feel ( the original ) since there was a girl on an all boys team , but there was okay feel to this movie over all . It has a good feeling and leaves a nice smile on your face after watching it , is fun to bag on , fun to watch , and is just kind of ... there . Plain . Good . Something you 'd watch after school before your pre - evening nap . As good as the day is long and it 's been a long , long day watching this movie ."

Train companies offered tourist the chance to shoot buffalo from the windows of their coaches ... There were even buffalo killing contests ... "" "" Buffalo "" "" Bill Cody killed thousands of buffalo ... Some U. S. government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds ... The buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting ... Few visionaries are working today to rebuild the once - great bison herds ... < br /><br />""""The Last Hunt "" "" holds one of Robert Taylor 's most dull and   unoriginal performances and for once failed in disregarding the theory that no audience would accept Taylor as a heavy guy ... <br /><br />His characterization of a sadistic buffalo hunter , who kills only for pleasure , had its potential : The will to do harm to another ... < br /><br />When he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker ( Stewart Granger ) it is evident that these two contrasted characters , with opposite ideas , will clash violently very soon ... <br /><br />Taylor 's shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts ... He also enjoy killing Indians who steal his horses ... He even tries to romance a beautiful squaw ( Debra Paget ) who shows less than generous to his needs and comfort ... <br /><br />Among others buffalo hunters are Lloyd Nolan , outstanding as a drunken buffalo skinner ; Russ Tamblyn as a half - breed ; and Constance Ford as the dance - hall girl ... But Taylor steals the show ... Richard Brooks attempts to capture ( in CinemaScope and Technicolor ) distant view of Buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these noble animals ... <br /><br />The film though is a terse , brutish outdoor Western with barely anything to say about old Western myths and an unoriginal climax in which the bad guy freezes to death while waiting all night to gun down the hero ...

Sondra Locke is bad in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge . Eastwood has many "" "" aside "" "" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot , but show Harry at his bad - assed worst . Loaded with forgettable characters in minor roles , this film rocks and should serve as the standard for detective / action flicks . This is the one Dirty Harry flick that 's raw and devoid of any "" "" fluff "" "" . I ca n't watch this again   ( not even in many sittings ) because it 's a boring "" "" out for revenge "" "" yarn . The pace is slow and several of the scenes are forgettable . "" "" Go ahead - Make my day ... You feel lucky , Punk ? .... "" "" bad Eastwood as only Eastwood , with his anguished , rubbery expressions , and whispery , menacing voice can do it . "
