One way to leverage the reasoning abilities of LLM is to let them explain a phenomenon to us. We can
prompt an LLM using a special question format, [phenomenon] + because, to let each of them generate
natural language explanations. For example:
1. The sky is turning dark because
2. When releasing a ball, it falls onto the ground because
3. When searching for “language model”, the search engine returns “ChatGPT” because

The generated explanations fall into several types. The explanations might (1) highlight the true underlying
causal mechanisms of the phenomenon, (2) identify a plausible mechanism to make the phenomenon appear
reasonable, or (3) describe some irrelevant information.
In this question, select two LMs – a large model (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT3, Cohere) and a smaller model
(e.g., BERT, GPT2, GPT-J), and prompt each of them with three phenomena. Report your choice of
models, phenomena, and their generated explanations. Comment on the qualities of the explanations: Are
the explanations convincing? Do the explanations highlight the true causes? Include the relevant scripts
and your discussions in bonusNLE.pdf, and include the PDF file in your submission.
